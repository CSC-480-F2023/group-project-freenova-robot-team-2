# CSC 480 Individual Requirements:
[Functional] Create a three-class YOLO object model.  (Sample size should be around 150-200 images taken in various backgrounds and angles per object.  The complexity of the chosen object will determine the sample size.) 

[Functional] The car shall stay within the provided boundary course. 

[Functional] The car shall avoid objects within the provided boundary course. 

[Functional] The car shall detect the objects found in its object model.  Upon detecting an object the following should occur:
Flash LEDs in a pattern indicating the object found 
- Drive towards the detected object and stop between one to two feet away from the object 
- Flash LEDs indicating movement toward the object has been completed 
- Pause the car for five seconds before continuing to the next object 

[Functional] The application completes once all objects are detected and object detection steps are completed.

## Constraints:
Must work in Python on a Raspberry Pi platform. Must also use A.I. to scan images and machine learning necessary to detect balls within its boundaries.


## Stakeholders:
### Users:
Mercer staff
Staff, like professors or maintenance, should be able to use our product. Mercer staff would be looking for more details and testing the extent of A.I. image recognition system, so they should be considered tech savvy. We should expect them to be critical of the system and be able to give substantial feedback on our product, ranging from code to quality control.
Mercer students
Students at Mercer are also very good at using technology and adapting to new products. They would be a very good type of user to test the product on and interview, however, we should not expect them to be as critical as professors may be simply because of a lack of experience.
Possible guests
This is a category of people in-between students and staff. They will most likely be not tech savvy and therefore even more casual at using our product than students.

### Acquirer:
Mercer University
After the project’s completion, our product’s name will be under Mercer University. The University will want our project to be working, they don’t care about its intricacies.

### Producer: 
Freenova Robot Team 2
As Freenova Robot Team 2, we will be producing this product and maintaining it through our vision.

### Regulator:
Dr. Allen & Professor Munday
Dr. Allen provided us with the project proposal, Professor Munday will be overseeing our project.
