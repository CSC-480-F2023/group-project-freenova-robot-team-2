# Freenova Robot Team 2

Team dedicated to making self-driving AI.

# How?

The Freenova Smart Car uses python client and server code for line tracking, object avoidance, face tracking, LEDs, and finally a trainable learning algorithm.

# Does it Get Any Better?

No, after a set amount of instructions it will only be able to recognize different colored balls and move them out the way. It is simple, yet simple and straightforward is always useful.
