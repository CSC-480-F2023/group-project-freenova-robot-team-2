+ I acted as a reviewer, my teammates both did different parts of the project requirements and I made sure that everything was consistent throughout and nothing was missed, specifically in whether or not we decided on the requirements being functional or non functional.
  
+ added "[Non-Functional] Streaming video to the client application to include object detection bounding boxes as to allow users to see the system work." as a non-functional requirement
+ added "[Non-Functional] (Sample size should be around 150-200 images taken in various backgrounds and angles per object.  The complexity of the chosen object will determine the sample size.)"
  
+ changed "[Non-Functional] The car shall stay within the provided boundary course and cannot utilize the line-tracking feature for finding the balls." from funtional to non-functional
+ changed "[Functional] Flash LEDs in a pattern indicating the object found" from non-functional to functional
+ changed "[Functional] Navigate a course by utilizing the infrared sensor to perform boundary detection and stay within the course (Note: boundary detection and not line tracking)" from nonfunctional to functional
