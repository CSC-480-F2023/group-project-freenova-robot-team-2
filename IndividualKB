I will work on the following requirements

[Functional]The application will use a provided sample Python client and server code for implementing line tracking, object avoidance, face tracking, LEDs, and other features. 
[Functional]TThe application will utilize a camera attachment, an infrared sensor, an ultrasound sensor, and other robotic parts to navigate an obstacle course. 
Variation 1 
[Functional] Navigate a course by utilizing the infrared sensor to perform boundary detection and stay within the course (Note: boundary detection and not line tracking)
[Functional] The car shall stop when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object which can be placed at the end of the track.
Variation 2 
[Functional] The car needs to be able to detect a ball within one foot. 
[Non- Functional] The application shall determine the color of the ball and change the vehicle LEDs to match the color of the ball. 
[Non- Functional] The application will pause the car for five seconds before continuing down the track. 
[Functional] Once a ball color is detected, the application shall ignore that color ball for the remainder of the program.
